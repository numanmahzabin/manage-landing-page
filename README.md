## My process

This project is a part of my Tailwind CSS learning. I was studying Tailwind CSS and to practice it, I designed this site

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS [CSS Framework]
- Google Fonts
- Google Icons
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first project in Tailwind CSS. I learned to make responsive and most importantly Mobile-first workflow. I learned to add custom fonts, colors in Tailwind.

Though I haven't learnt making slide bar with Tailwind. Therefore, I couldn't add the Slide bar in testimonial part. I'll, when I have this in hands.

### Continued development

I would like focus on making mobile menu bar with raw Javascript. As Tailwind doesn't have any builtin components, I had to do it all on my own. Also I need to focus on making slide bar. Besides, background position, forms are also where I need to pay attention.

### Useful resources

- https://tailwindcss.com/ - I was learning Tailwind CSS and the entire design was made with Tailwind
- https://fonts.google.com/ - I used 'Be Vietnam Pro' font from this site. Also I used the menu icon from the google icons.
- https://github.com/ - I deployed my site here.
